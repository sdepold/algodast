/*
  Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the begin- ning of the loop
  DEFINITION
  Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list
  EXAMPLE
  input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
  output: C
